# The Valley of the Shadow

The Valley of the Shadow is a digital archive of primary sources that document the lives of people in Augusta County, Virginia, and Franklin County, Pennsylvania, during the era of the American Civil War. This version of the Valley project is available online at [valley.newamericanhistory.org](https://valley.newamericanhistory.org).

This codebase is built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com). It migrates the data from previous versions of the Valley project into a database and exposes an API that powers the new Valley of the Shadow. API endpoints are accessible at [api.valley.newamericanhistory.org/api](https://api.valley.newamericanhistory.org/api).
