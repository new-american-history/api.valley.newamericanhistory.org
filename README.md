# The Valley of the Shadow

The Valley of the Shadow is a digital archive of primary sources that document the lives of people in Augusta County, Virginia, and Franklin County, Pennsylvania, during the era of the American Civil War. A new version of the Valley project is currently under development.

This codebase is built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com). It migrates the data from previous versions of the Valley project into a database and exposes an API that powers the new Valley of the Shadow. API endpoints are accessible at [api.valley.newamericanhistory.org/api](https://api.valley.newamericanhistory.org/api).
